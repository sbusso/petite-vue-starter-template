# Petite Vue Starter template

Simple starter template for [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue). With [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/). It doesnt require node bundler and provides assets using cdn for quick start. 

Good for prototyping, not recommended for minimal setup as tailwind and daisy frameworks are fully loaded and not purged.
